A pixelated drawing pad which emulates the appearance of an Etch-a-Sketch.

The user starts with an arbitrary 55x55 grid to draw on.  Hitting the reset button erases the drawing entirely.  The resize button allows the user to choose a screen size between 1x1 and 200x200 to adjust the thickness of their lines.

The goal of this project is to gain more experience manipulating the DOM.
